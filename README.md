# Written Convention

This project utilizes one long-running branch called `main`. Main should not be directly pushed to, instead merged with other branches when developing.

## Pull Request Workflow
- Push all changes to your working branch, then make a pull request
- This pull request must be reviewed by one of the developers peers before merging into main
